# üö¢ Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts survival outcomes of Titanic passengers using Logistic Regression.

## üìå Overview

- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing (handled missing values, encoded categories)
- Built a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn
- Achieved **~77% accuracy on Kaggle test data**
- Generated a `submission.csv` file for submission to Kaggle

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib (for EDA)

## üìÅ Files

- `Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb` ‚Äì Main notebook (EDA + model)
- `submission.csv` ‚Äì Predictions for Kaggle test set
- `requirements.txt` ‚Äì Dependencies

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: `train.csv` and `test.csv` must be downloaded from the [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) and placed in the same directory.
